## Description
Horror nas Colinas Negras is a 2D animation project, developed in Godot Engine, that tells the story of two detectives who are investigating a series of murders in the middle of the forest.

#### Know the characters
- **Marcos Valentino**: A clumsy and extroverted detective. He's always trying to make jokes, taking the weight off any situation. He has a positive mindset, but can that positivity be enough to get through the horrors of the forest?

- **Lara Vicenza**: A young detective that is always focused and serious, only laughing at Marcus jokes. She takes precautions in every situation, and is ready for anything. Unfortunately, there's no preparation that she can do to escape what awaits her in the forest.
